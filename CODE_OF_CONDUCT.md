# Community Code of Conduct

We want to keep the Open Cluster Management Community a great place to participate, and we need your help to keep it that way.

Our community is made up of a wonderful and diverse mix of individuals from all over the world; we span cultures, languages, and continents!

We contribute the code and ideas that make Open Cluster Management the best it can be technically. 

We have fun doing it, and we want you to as well. To do this, we want it to be a safe and friendly place for everyone.

We're proud to be a CNCF project, and our community abides by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Should you encounter a violation of this Code of Conduct please report it to the [Open Cluster Management Maintainers private email alias](mailto:cncf-ocm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io) If the CoC violation involves a member of [the Maintainers](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md), please escalate the report to the CNCF Conduct staff. All reports will be kept confidential.
